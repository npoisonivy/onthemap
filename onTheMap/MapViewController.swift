/**
 * This view controller demonstrates the objects involved in displaying pins on a map.
 *
 * The map is a MKMapView.
 * The pins are represented by MKPointAnnotation instances.
 *
 * The view controller conforms to the MKMapViewDelegate so that it can receive a method
 * invocation when a pin annotation is tapped. It accomplishes this using two delegate
 * methods: one to put a small "info" button on the right side of each pin, and one to
 * respond when the "info" button is tapped.
